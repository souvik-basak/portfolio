    "body": "I’m currently contributing to frontend development at DNA/Zummit Infolabs, where I build and optimize modern web applications using React.js, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. One of my proudest contributions was optimizing a Photographer Portfolio website, improving load time by 700ms and creating a smoother, more engaging visual experience. I also helped build a scalable HRMS portal, implementing over 10+ frontend components, integrating APIs, and writing unit tests that enhanced code quality and performance."
